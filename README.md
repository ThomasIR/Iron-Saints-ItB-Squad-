# Iron-Saints-ItB-Squad-
My first mod for Into the Breach. Adds a new squad built around the gameplan of provoking enemies to attack your Mechs.

Special thanks to Pilot_Arrogant, Lemonymous, GenericCorporatePilotno2005, Machin, Hedera, NamesAreHard, and probably others I'm forgetting for getting me up to speed on ItB modding, as well as to tosx for letting me use his Windriders mod as a kitbash source.
